# RevitToolbar

This is my first .NET Revit plugin.
There are several buttons with different functionality, ranging from getting the element id to finding intersecting elements. To install:
1. Clone repo
2. Build solution
3. Transfer .addin, .pdb, & .dll to C:\Users\*NAME*\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2021
4. Launch Revit 2021
